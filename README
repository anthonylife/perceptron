================================================================

Perceptron learing algorithm for mail classification.
This program perform all the procudures in order.
Procedure: 1.Extract main text from mails and create word tokens;
           2.Get the stem of words and remove stop words;
           3.Word Feature Selection by gini index and frequency
           4.Compute TF-IDF and output feature file
           5. 5-fold cross validation
             5.1 partition
             5.2 train
             5.3 test
             5.4 average and get F-score


Third-parity libaries
=====================

nltk(python): http://nltk.org/
    -- I use nltk.word_tokenize() function to seperate the irregular mail text.

porter stem(python): http://pypi.python.org/pypi/stemming/1.0
    -- I use stemming.porter2.stem() function to get stemming words.

scipy, numpy(python): 
    -- I use numpy to speed vector dot, and scipy.sparse.csr_matrix() function to get sparse representation.


Quick Start
===========
run.py:
    -- It includes all the process in this programming. In order to run this script, people should install all the third-party python libaries, including nltk, porter stemmer, scipy and numpy.

run.simple.py:
    -- This scripy only includes partition, training and testing procedure. People only need to have Scipy and Numpy installed.


Final result
===========
After one time of 5-fold cross-validation, the final result is below:

The F-score of class "Baseball" 0.945564 ...
The F-score of class "Hockey" 0.946567 ...
